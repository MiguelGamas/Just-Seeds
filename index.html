            It only costs 2€, and since we are in a lockdown, we take it to
            you for free! The package and the product are both
            made by hand and out of re-used plastic and paper.

            As you can see in the images, the box comes with a draw
            of the seed, plenty of space for them and comes
            in diferent sizes and shapes aqueated for every seeds
